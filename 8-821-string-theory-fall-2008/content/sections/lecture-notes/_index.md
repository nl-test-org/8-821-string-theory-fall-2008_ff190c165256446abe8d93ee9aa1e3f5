Each lecture, one person volunteered to be the scribe for that lecture, and was responsible for taking notes and preparing them in LaTeX. After (hopefully minor) revisions, the instructor posted them for the rest of the students to see. To help in writing up the lectures notes, the instructor gave the scribe a copy of his written notes, and sometimes an audio recording of the lecture as well.

Notes are used with the permission of the student scribe.
