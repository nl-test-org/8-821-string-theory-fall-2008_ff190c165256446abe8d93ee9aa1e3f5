[Third Law of Black-Hole Dynamics: A Formulation and Proof](http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v57/i4/p397_1): This paper formulates and proves a precise version of the third law for black holes. A proof of the Zeroth Law can be found in Wald, GR, pp. 333-334.

[The String Landscape, Black Holes and Gravity as the Weakest Force](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0601001): This is a paper which says something interesting about arbitrarily-weakly-gauged symmetries and black holes.

[UV/IR Relations in AdS Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9809022): This paper has some thoughtful discussion of the relationship between the radial coordinate of AdS and various energy scales in the field theory.

[Aspects of Large N Gauge Theory Dynamics as seen by String Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9805129) (section 4) and [All-Genus Calculation of Wilson Loops using D-branes](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0501109): These two papers describe bulk calculations of Wilson loops in representations other than the fundamental.

[Scale and Conformal Invariance in Quantum Field Theory](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(88)90179-4): This is the Polchinski paper about the relation between scale invariance and conformal invariance.

Pointlike Structures Inside and Outside Hadrons: Coleman's &grave;1/N' paper ([PDF - 1.3 MB](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4684-1065-5))#

[Introduction to Conformal Invariance](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1974.tb20531.x): Callan's review of conformal symmetry in QFT

Supersymmetry and Non-perturbative Beta Functions: This is a non-perturbative proof of the vanishing of the beta function of the N=4 SYM theory ([PDF](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0370-2693(88)91265-8
))#

[Comments on Higher Derivative Operators in Some SUSY Field Theories](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9705057): This is a discussion of a nonzero supersymmetric higher-dimension correction to the effective action.

[The Weinberg-Witten Theorem on Massless Particles](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119816849/abstract): This is a review of the Weinberg-Witten theorem.

[Topics in Particle Physics and Cosmology Beyond the Standard Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0607239): Alejandro Jenkins' thesis, chapter 2, is another review of the Weinberg-Witten theorem.
